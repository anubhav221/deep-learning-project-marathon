## Welcome to my first blog

First of all i want to thank all of the readers who are reading my blog. 
So this is basically about the project that i will make and i have taken the topic from another amazing blog in dataflair [blog link](https://data-flair.training/blogs/deep-learning-project-ideas/)

## What i will do in this projects?

I will first write the code and will show you output then i will explain the math behind the project in my blog and in my you tube channel. 

## what type of project we will do?

We will be doing projects related to different topics of deep learning. I will categorize the projects in three sections **beginner**, **intermediate** and **advance**. And i will try to do projects as much as i can.

## list of projects : 

-**beginner**
  1. Predict Next Sequence
