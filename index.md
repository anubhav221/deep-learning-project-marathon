## Welcome to my first blog

First of all i want to thank all of the readers who are reading my blog. 
So this is basically about the project that i will make and i have taken the topic from another amazing blog in dataflair [blog link](https://data-flair.training/blogs/deep-learning-project-ideas/)

## What i will do in this projects?

I will first write the code and will show you output then i will explain the math behind the project in my blog and in my you tube channel. 

## what type of project we will do?

We will be doing projects related to different topics of deep learning. I will categorize the projects in three sections **beginner**, **intermediate** and **advance**. And i will try to do projects as much as i can.

## list of projects : 

- **beginner**
  1. Predict Next Sequence
  2. Cats vs Dogs
  3. Build your Own Neural Net from Scratch
  4. Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset
  5. Human Face Detection
  6. Dogâ€™s Breed Identification
  
- **intermediate**
  1. Traffic Sign Classification
  2. Automatic Music Generation
  3. Breast Cancer Classification
  4. Music Genre Classification
  5. Text Summarizer
  6. Gender Recognition Using Voice
  7. Chatbot Using Deep Learning
  8. Neural Style Transfer
  9. Face Aging

- **advance**
  1. Gender and Age Detection
  2. Driver Drowsiness Detection
  3. Human Pose Estimation
  4. Human Activity Recognition with Video Classification
  5. Image Caption Generator
  6. Generate Human Faces with DCGAN
  7. Variational Autoencoders
  8. Colourizing Old B&W Images
  9. Language Translator

## order of making project 

So i will first make all this projects in order BIA order of projects in each level is not fixed as written above.
